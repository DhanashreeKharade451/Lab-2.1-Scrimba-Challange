Answers to Reflection Questions:
*******************************
1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
The most challanging part was missing labels for input fields.
It took my time to find the missing values.

****************************************************************
2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

ARIA provides way to make an application and dynamic content more accessible to assistive technologies such as screen reader and voice recognition software. 
*****************************************************************
3.  What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

I used the "WebAIM Color Contrast" Checker to verify that the text and background colors met WCAG accessibility guidelines. This tool helped me ensure sufficient contrast ratios for normal and large text, making the content readable for users with visual impairments. I adjusted font colors and background colors in my HTML and CSS to meet accessibility standards based on the tool’s feedback.
