Answers of the reflection Questions:

1.What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
One of the main accessibility challenges was adding media and adjusting it according to screen size.
I was struggaling with it because I placed media at wrong place.

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
To ensure responsiveness, I used Flexbox for the navigation bar and CSS Grid for the main content layout. Media queries were added at 600px breakpoints so the layout could adapt smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. On smaller devices, multi-column layouts collapsed into a single column for better readability.

3.What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
Browser developer tools were useful for testing responsive layouts at different screen sizes.

Additionally, MDN Web Docs provided clear guidance on semantic HTML, Flexbox, Grid, and ARIA attributes. Finally, using VS Code with Live Server allowed me to quickly preview changes and test responsiveness and accessibility in real time.
